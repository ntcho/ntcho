## 👋 Hi! I'm Nathan.

### 🌏 What I’m doing now

I’m now serving my military duty for my country in South Korea until **July 2022**.

### 👨‍💻 What I (used to) do

I’ve built multiple mobile apps and web services so far, and I’m exploring the broader world of computer science now.

I am learning from [Computer Science and Engineering major](https://cse.cau.ac.kr) at [Chung-Ang Univerisity](https://cau.ac.kr) in Seoul, South Korea.

### 🚀 What inspires me

I inspire to utilitize the power of computer to improve everyone’s life. I wonder and imagine how far we, as humans, will be in 10 years.

### ✨ Other things I'm interested in

I love videography and photography! Capturing beautiful moments and telling interesting stories always excites me. 🎥📸

I also write some stuff on [my blog on GitHub](https://ntcho.github.io) too.
